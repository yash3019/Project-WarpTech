        <p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts.
            It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of
            technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is
            sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

            Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources about
            HTML5 technologies, classified into several groups based on their function.
