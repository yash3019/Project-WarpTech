        <h3>What is Java? </h3>
        <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure
            programming language.

            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James
            Gosling
            is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company,
            so
            James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.
            <ul>
                <li >Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years.</li>
                <li >Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support
                    for
                    primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
                <li >The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is
                    run
                    on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
                <li >Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities
                    like
                    pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
                <li >Java is used in all kind of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java based), desktop
                    applications, web applications, client server applications, enterprise applications and many more.
                </li>
                <li >When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many
                    things which may lead bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives
                    are
                    always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we
                    always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is
                    also
                    not possible.</li>
                <li >When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs written in Java
                    typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does
                    static
                    type checking, but Python does not.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Applications-</h3>
        <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of
            them
            are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li >Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
                <li >Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
                <li >Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
                <li >Mobile</li>
                <li >Embedded System</li>
                <li >Smart Card</li>
                <li >Robotics</li>
                <li >Games, etc.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Features of Java-</h3>
        <p>The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure
            programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role
            in
            the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as java buzzwords.

            A list of most important features of Java language is given below.
            <ol>


                <li >Java Features</li>
                <li >Simple</li>
                <li >Secured</li>
                <li >Robust</li>
                <li >High Performance</li>
                <li >Multithreaded</li>
                <li >Distributed</li>
                <li >Dynamic</li>
            </ol>

        </p>
        <h2>Object-oriented-</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we
            organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and
            behavior.

            Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by
            providing some rules.Basic concepts of OOPs are:


            <ol>
                <li >Object</li>
                <li >Class</li>
                <li >Inheritance</li>
                <li >Polymorphism</li>
                <li >Abstraction</li>
                <li >Encapsulation</li>
            </ol>
